        "question": "What is the best compromise between spreading factor and coding rate?",
        "answer": "Consider the following scenario: the payload data packets are running at 9600 bit/s, with a 250 kHz bandwidth. In these conditions the LoRa Calculator Tool offers two possibilities that are compatible with the 9600 kbit/s speed: a) SF7 and coding rate 4/5, giving a maximum payload rate of 10937 bit/s. b) SF6 and coding rate 4/8 (a much better FEC), giving a maximum payload rate of 11718 bit/s. The second option is certainly better, if the link margin is sufficient. For the same time-on-air, you have more redundancy, which will give you a better chance to recover the packet in case of a nasty, high-power, in-band interference. At the cost of a small sensitivity hit, of about 2.5dB."

        "answer": "This method is extremely widespread in the industry, for instance in drive-by smart-metering scenario where an interrogator is present and sends a long preamble to wake-up a device for seldom interrogation. It is all a trade-off between Rx duty-cycle (energy efficiency on the Rx), length of the interrogating preamble, and over-hearing. The source has to be clever enough to detect false interrogations and adapt itself to fake interrogations, for example due to a raise in the noise floor in the channel. Typically, wake-up on RSSI is used and self-adapting RSSI threshold helps mitigate over-hearing, which is harmful for the battery lifetime."

The LoRa receiver is able to demodulate RF packets with a SNR as low as -20 dB in SF12. Anything higher than +5 dB is meaningless, and should be considered as there being \"plenty of signal\"."

        "answer": "The typical channel spacing for LoRa and LoRaWAN is 200 kHz, which is the separation between two channels (if you have one device running at 912.2 MHz, the next one would be at 912 or 912.4 MHz). In principle, LoRa gives proper separation (selectivity) with more than 1.5*LoRaBW as far as channel separation goes. This would be at the minimum 178.5 kHz. Any lower separation would yield lower isolation and therefore more collision chances, the larger the better."

        "answer": "Transceivers used in LoRa®-connected end-devices are frequency-agile, i.e. they have a fast switching PLL onboard. During the uplink, they use a first channel (say 902 MHz), and it is very easy and fast to change the frequency to, for instance, 920 MHz, before the transceiver is turned to reception mode. This takes typically 100 microseconds to do. Both the uplink and downlink messages are transmitted on determined channels. For example, on class A devices the uplink channels are controlled by the channel mask (ChMask) , whereas the downlink channels are either a function of the uplink channel or configurable through MAC commands."

        "answer": "LoRa is a spread-spectrum modulation and offers throughputs from 300 bit/s to 11 kbit/s in the EU LoRaWAN implementation. The next proposed setting is FSK 50 kbit/s, which LoRa doesn't currently achieve. The intent in this definition is to offer a way to \"throttle\", that means to increase the bit rate when the device is close to the gateway. This has multiple benefits, such as reducing the transmission time and saving the battery, reducing the chances of collision and therefore packet loss, and increasing the capacity of the networks."

The LoRa Alliance has standardized a way to group devices together in a Multicast group for concurrent update, and an efficient Transport layer with built-in redundancy for optimized file delivery. The idea is to switch the node in class B or in class C and to send data from the server. There are examples of FUOTA (firmware upgrade over the air) available from several partners of the LoRa Alliance."

        "question": "How do I choose the best LoRa modulation parameters and what is the trade-off?",
        "answer": "Let's take an example to best illustrate a choice between equivalent modulation parameters. In the first case we have Bandwidth (BW) 125 kHz and Spreading Factor at SF12. This results in a data rate at 30 symbols/sec and Rx sensitivity at -137 dBm. Let's compare this with BW 10.4 kHz and SF8, which results in very similar result: data rate at 40 symbols/sec and Rx sensitivity of -138 dBm. The trade-off here is that with BW 10.4 kHz, you will have to use a TCXO which adds cost to your system. Contrarily, at BW 125 kHz, you do not need a TCXO anymore. At the end of the day, it is simply a matter of cost versus performance."

        "answer": "Whether private or public, overlapping networks in a specific geographical area will share the medium, and therefore the collision rate will increase. The common techniques which can be used to alleviate this situation is the use of Clear Channel Assessment, which evaluates the \"cleanness\" of a channel by using spectral scanning techniques (and therefore adapt the channel plan), and implements retries in packet transmission to maximize success rate. When it comes to the access point side (gateways), the use of the\"private\" sync word versus \"public\" sync word is useful to ensure that the gateways don't report a vast majority of the incoming traffic using a different setting."

The algorithm is actually controlled by the network server and the network server will send a MAC command to increase or decrease the data rate depending on the received signal level. When using confirmed messages on the node side, if the node does not receive the acknowledge, it will automatically decrease the packet data rate."

        "answer": "Each SX1257/50/55 chip can digitize almost 1 MHz of spectrum, therefore two are required typically to achieve 8 channels with a channel separation of 200 kHz or so. The limitation of using a single SX1257/50/55 chip and one SX1301/08/02 chip is that you can only digitize 1 MHz of spectrum (and not 2 MHz) and can only build a 4 channel modem since the channels are spaced 200 kHz apart."

        "answer": "Per the test results that we have gathered and shared, there is no benefit in using spreading factor diversity. Diversity should however be part of the ADR strategy: frequency and time diversity are highly beneficial. SF12 makes sense for static end-devices which are at the limit of coverage, typically with a repetition order of 4 (NbTrans=4). In many situations of mobile devices it is certainly better to use a low spreading factor (e.g., SF7) and a high repetition rate, up to 15 times, which maximizes time and frequency diversity."

        "answer": "For noise immunity (digital to RF), it is safer to use a separate 3.3 V power rail between SX1308 baseband chip and SX1257 RF transceivers. SE2435L RF front-end uses two power rails: 3.3 V (VCC0) and 2.0 V (VCC1 and VCC2). Concerning the 3.3 V (VCC0), it is already shared with the 3.3 V LDO SX1257 radio_A on the reference block diagram and schematic of Picocell Gateway. You can keep it this way. You can share the same 3.3 V power rail between the two SX1257 radio_A and radio_B RF transceivers. This 3.3 V power rail can also be used to supply the 32MHz TCXO. In summary, two separate 3.3V power rails are recommended: For more details, see the Picocell Gateway reference design."

        "answer": "The SX1257 can not demodulate LoRa or FSK modulations. It just downconverts a 1 MHz chunk spectrum in the 800/900 MHz frequency band in raw I and Q signals at baseband. The 4 channels of a SX1257 can be freely configured to the same, overlapping or adjacent frequencies. Using two SX1257 at the same frequency will not improve the reception sensitivity or capacity if both SX1257 share the same antenna. You can use two 180-degree directional antennas oriented one to the north and the other to the south improving sensitivity, or better two omnidirectional antennas separated 1 meter with each other for diversity, mitigating the multipath. Two signals on the same frequency and the same SF will interfere with each other. If one signal is, for example, 30 dB higher than the other, you will receive only the strongest one. Two signals on the same frequency and different SF will interfere with each other, but as SF are orthogonal to each other. If one signal is, for example, 12 dB higher than the other, you will receive both signals. If not, you will receive only the strongest one."

There is no block at the antenna to perform this estimation, but a baseband RSSI  \"sx1301_rssi \" is estimated inside the SX1301 chip. Then the RSSI (at the antenna) is calculated by subtracting the gain of the Rx chain  \"Rx_gain\" to the baseband_rssi: sx1301_rssi = Input_level_antenna (=RSSI) + Rx_gain This implies that RSSI =   sx1301_rssi €\" Rx_Gain. The RSSI value is read from the SX1301's packet buffer and is then summed with the rssi_offset:RSSI = sx1301_rssi + rssi_offset => so rssi_offset = -Rx_gain The accuracy of the RSSI value depends of two factors: The Rx gain includes analog gain (from antenna to ADC block) as well as digital gain.

        "question": "What is antenna gain offset?",
        "answer": "Depending on the network server used, the antenna gain offset calculation is done in the server or in the gateway. In recent versions of the packet forwarder, there is an entry in the\"global_conf.json\" file that looks like this:  \"antenna_gain\": 0, /* antenna gain, in dBi */ This \"antenna_gain\" can be used to compensate the gateway Tx Ouput Power  \"rf_power\" by the gateway itself, not by the network server. Indeed, the  \"rf_power\" field for each entry of the Tx LUT, defined in the  \"global_conf.json\" too, corresponds usually to the conducted Tx Output Power, not the radiated one. For instance, the  \"rf_power\" along with its gain fields (\"pa_gain\",\"mix_gain\" and\"dig_gain\") can come from a generic/conducted (i.e. without any antenna) calibration performed at production time. So, afterwards, you can define the \"antenna_gain\" in the\"global_conf.json\" configuration file to take into account any gain of the antenna mounted on the gateway in the field. In the packet_forwarder program of the gateway, the  \"antenna_gain\" field is subtracted from the  \"rf_power\" field for all Tx LUT entries as follow: final_rf_power = rf_power - antenna_gain. \"antenna_gain\" must be a signed 8-bit integer, from -128 to +127."

        "answer": "There are some technical differences between LoRaWAN  and alternative LPWAN technologies which enable a much broader set of applications to be addressed from a bi-directional connectivity, adaptive data rate and end point class perspective, but the key differentiator is the ecosystem, the Certification Program and standardization. If you look at successful technology adoption over the past 10 years all have followed this model. Having different business models, competition, and a diverse ecosystem with industry leaders is the only way to scale volume and deployments. An open standard is also a proven strategy to get acceptance and wide deployment versus proprietary technology, the choice of the various network components; gateways, end-devices, cloud network servers along with chips, development kits and end products from many different suppliers offers a low risk strategy for potential operators or end users. Last but not least LoRaWAN protects data and privacy like no other LPWAN, it is the most secure solution available in the market with AES 128 encryption on multiple levels for all data from sensor to application server and back."

However, depending upon the requirements of your application, it is certainly possible to configure the modem to one of several setting that will optimize performance.Longest Range Setting:  This configuration is achieved by using the lowest bandwidth and highest spreading factor. Note that the increased sensitivity is achieved at the expense of a lower bitrate, so longer time on air.Highest Accuracy Ranging Setting:  The highest accuracy ranging setting is achieved by setting the highest bandwidth and the highest spreading factor (1.6 MHz SF 10 in the case of ranging which does not operate at Spreading Factors above this).Lowest Energy / Highest Data Rate Setting:  The lowest energy setting of the SX1280 LoRa modem, is to set the SF as low as possible and the bandwidth as high as possible.

        "answer": "The immunity of the SX1280 LoRa modem varies as a function spreading factor, bandwidth, the type of Wi-Fi interference and the frequency offset between the interferer and the wanted LoRa signal.For some OFDM types of Wi-Fi and with low bandwidth, low spreading factor we can get in excess of 60 dB co-channel immunity. The best mechanism to avoid WiFi interference, in general however, will be to avoid the interference by using unoccupied portions of the band. The image below shows our immunity at SF12 200 kHz as a function of frequency, here we see that on the same channel (0 Hz offset) we still have good immunity (45 dB) as we move further away in frequency (the ISM band is 80 MHz wide) we can get in excess of 100 dB of immunity.   There is a little up-tick in the immunity at 0 Hz offset. The reason for this is shown in the second figure. Here the blue trace is the measured WiFi signal spectrum. You can also see here the actual measurement points (red dots). The precise immunity will depend upon the exact power level (here in 200 kHz) of the (blue) WiFi signal. More comprehensive coverage of this topic can be found in our WiFi immunity application note."

        "answer": "To avoid re-work and modification of the component values on the RF output of SX1280 it is necessary to follow the reference design as closely as possible. The harmonic filter of SX1280 (magenta) and impedance match (cyan) in particular need to be replicated identically.   Where possible the same family of components as specified in the BOM should also be used. It is possible, in some applications, that VCO leakage in receive mode can be seen. An effective remedy for this is to take the initial precaution of adding series resistances R7 to R10 to the digital lines. Moreover, a 4-layer design allows the DC-DC converter traces to be buried on internal PCB layer 3 (see below) between ground planes on layers 2 and 4."

One of the tests required is the Continuous Wave radio test (also called Tx-Cw) which is described in another article. Another test requires setting the radio in continuous modulated signal to measure the spectral occupation taken by the radio signal when transmitting packets. To this aim, it is often required for the radio to transmit pseudo-random binary PN9 or PN15 payloads. There is no easy way to perform this test and the only solution is to create the payloads on the companion MCU and then send the packets one by one, with a different PNx sequence generated from the MCU. Here, care must be taken in the time between packets which will have an influence on the spurious emissions generated by the PA ramp-up and down in quick succession."

To maximize both battery life of the end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRaWAN network server is managing the data rate and RF output power for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) algorithm. The ADR is critical for a high performance network and it enables scalability. A network can be deployed with a minimal investment in infrastructure, and as capacity is needed, more gateways can be deployed and  the ADR will shift the data rates higher which will scale the network capacity."

They are multi-channel, multi-modem transceivers and can demodulate on multiple channels simultaneously and even demodulate multiple signals on the same channel simultaneously due to the properties of LoRa. The gateways use different RF components than the end-point to enable high capacity and serve as a transparent bridge relaying messages between end-devices and a central network server via standard IP connections while end-devices use single-hop wireless communication to one or many gateways. All end-point communication is generally bi-directional, but also supports operations such as multicast enabling, software upgrade, over the air or other mass distribution messages to reduce the on air communication time. There are different gateway versions depending the desired capacity and installation location (home vs. tower). The term gateway and concentrator are both used, but they are equivalent components in a LoRa system. In other industries the definition of gateway and concentrator may imply different components."

        "answer": "Each network ID type corresponds to a different addressing space for end-devices, ranging from 128 addresses to 33 million addresses. Many end-devices may share the same address in a network, as the device identifier is the combination of DevAddr and network session key. The devices number can thus reach 1 billion for a single NetID. If a network exceeds this value, it will be allocated additional NetID(s) by the LoRa Alliance."

If it negotiates 32 seconds with the network, then on average, it will be listening to the network every 32 seconds. When the load increases for Class B on a specific gateway, the impact is not delay but potentially overhearing of more than 1 device on a defined  \"meeting point\", in other words if the gateway is out of time slots, it may assign the same time slot to multiple devices. This would cause these devices to lengthen their listening time (and therefore consume more energy), even when the  \"other\" device is interrogated. This impact is mild obviously, on the basis that network actuation is meant to be scarce (a few times per day typically)."

SCHC is a compression and fragmentation mechanism that was specified in 2020 and makes LoRaWAN capable to support internet-based applications such as DLMS protocol used in smart metering,  or CoAP for supporting protocol like LwM2M. Compared to 6LoWPAN that was designed in 2005 for enabling IP over 802.15.4 and for home automation application mainly , SCHC brings much better efficiency for constrained networks than 6LoWPAN does. Actility (a LoRa partner) and other partners are enabling applications using SCHC on top of LoRaWAN. NB: SCHC can also be used for optimizing or enabling IPv6 over Nb-IoT."

        "answer": "The LoRa modulation itself is a PHY that can be used in all network topologies. A mesh network extends the range of the network but comes at the cost of reduced network capacity, synchronization overhead, and reduced battery lifetime due to synchronization and hops. The increased link budget and range capability of LoRa, removes the  need for a mesh network architecture to extend the range for most application, so a star architecture was chosen for LoRaWAN to optimize the network capacity, battery lifetime, and easy installation. Mesh networks based on LoRa can be pertinent for some use cases, such as linear infrastructure monitoring."

        "answer": "The FIFO of most LoRa device is 256 bytes deep in LoRa mode. In theory, all the 256Bytes can be used for TX or RX. However, with a low data-rate configuration, the time on air with a 256byte payload will be very long (several seconds or even longer), which is not good for resisting fading and high interference environments. This is not a robust configuration in most environments so it is suggested that if a long payload is desired with a low data-rate then the packet be split into a few shorter packets."

As you know, LoRa can demodulate the packet below the noise floor (PktRssi result) then CurrentRssi will then be equal to or more than the noise floor. For more details about how to calculate these two RSSI Values, please refer to the Semtech API or latest LoRa datasheets."

        "answer": "When you start your design, check the DIO Mapping in both the LoRa mode and FSK mode. You can find the DIO Mapping information in all Semtech LoRa® product datasheets. The DIOs do not function as normal (typical) MCU GPIOs. There are some special interrupt signals (or clock outputs) to indicate the event or status of the chipset, which then make your FW design easier to implement. In theory, you could connect no DIOs and then poll the related register to know the status result. However, we suggest that you connect the DIO as much as possible for external interrupt functionality which saves on the resource loading of the MCU and permits a very low-power operation mode (the MCU can sleep while packet it Tx'ed or Rx'ed)."

        "answer": "In LoRa mode, even if the CRC is wrong the payload will be filled into the FIFO. Bit PayloadCrcError must be checked before fetching the payload to know its integrity. In Explicit Header mode, there is a small probability that a false detection creates a  \"ghost\" packet. Either the false header has CrcOn bit turned on, and then the payload will be wrong, and the modem will flag it as a PayloadCrcError condition, so packet can easily be filtered out. Or the false header has CrcOn disabled, in which case the mode will consider the packet as a good one. These infrequent bad packet will have a random length (extracted from the false header info), and can be easily filtered by the host, for instance by seeing that their size is unexpected."

For example, nodes close to the gateway will use a higher data rate (shorter time on air) and a lower output power. Only Nodes that are at the very edge of the link budget will use the lowest data rate and highest output power. The ADR method can accommodate changes in the network infrastructure and support varying path loss. To maximize both battery life of end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRa network infrastructure manages the data rate and RF output for each end node individually by implementing ADR."
