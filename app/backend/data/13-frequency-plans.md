# Frequency Plans

This is a list of frequency plan definitions used in The Things Network. These frequency plans are based on what is specified in the LoRaWAN regional parameters document. To know which frequency plan to use in your country, see the list of frequency plans by country list .
## EU863-870

Uplink:

Downlink:
* Uplink channels 1-9 (RX1)
* **869.525** - SF9BW125 (RX2)

##### Note:

 The Things Network uses the non-standard SF9BW125 data rate for RX2 in Europe. If your devices use OTAA, this will be configured automatically when they join. If your devices use ABP, you will need to program this RX2 data rate into the devices in order to make them work with TTN.

## AS923

We use two frequency plans, depending on the country. OTAA devices use two common channels: 923.2MHz and 923.4MHz. They will receive the additional channels on a successful join.
