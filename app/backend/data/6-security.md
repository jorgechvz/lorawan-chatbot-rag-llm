# Security

## Security Keys

LoRaWAN 1.0 specifies a number of security keys: NwkSKey , AppSKey and AppKey . All keys have a length of 128 bits.
The algorithm used for this is AES-128, similar to the algorithm used in the 802.15.4 standard.
### Session Keys

When a device joins the network (this is called a join or activation), an application session key AppSKey and a network session key NwkSKey are generated. The NwkSKey is shared with the network, while the AppSKey is kept private. These session keys will be used for the duration of the session.
The Network Session Key ( NwkSKey ) is used for interaction between the Node and the Network Server. This key is used to validate the integrity of each message by its Message Integrity Code (MIC check). This MIC is similar to a checksum, except that it prevents intentional tampering with a message. For this, LoRaWAN uses AES-CMAC. In the backend of The Things Network this validation is also used to map a non-unique device address ( DevAddr ) to a unique DevEUI and AppEUI .
The Application Session Key ( AppSKey ) is used for encryption and decryption of the payload. The payload is fully encrypted between the Node and the Handler/Application Server component of The Things Network (which you will be able to run on your own server). This means that nobody except you is able to read the contents of messages you send or receive.
These two session keys ( NwkSKey and AppSKey ) are unique per device, per session. If you dynamically activate your device (OTAA), these keys are re-generated on every activation. If you statically activate your device (ABP), these keys stay the same until you change them.
### Application Key

The application key ( AppKey ) is only known by the device and by the application. Dynamically activated devices (OTAA) use the Application Key ( AppKey ) to derive the two session keys during the activation procedure. In The Things Network you can have a AppKey which will be used to activate all devices, or customize the AppKey per device.
## Frame Counters

Because we’re working with a radio protocol, anyone will be able to capture and store messages. It’s not possible to read these messages without the AppSKey , because they’re encrypted. Nor is it possible to tamper with them without the NwkSKey , because this will make the MIC check fail. It is however possible to re-transmit the messages. These so-called replay attacks can be detected and blocked using frame counters.
When a device is activated, these frame counters ( FCntUp and FCntDown ) are both set to 0 . Every time the device transmits an uplink message, the FCntUp is incremented and every time the network sends a downlink message, the FCntDown is incremented. If either the device or the network receives a message with a frame counter that is lower than the last one, the message is ignored.
This security measure has consequences for development devices, which often are statically activated (ABP). When you do this, you should realize that these frame counters reset to 0 every time the device restarts (when you flash the firmware or when you unplug it). As a result, The Things Network will block all messages from the device until the FCntUp becomes higher than the previous FCntUp . Therefore, you should re-register your device in the backend every time you reset it.
## Spread Spectrum

Spread Spectrum Radio Transmission was traditionally used, during WW2, to make military communications difficult to monitor - either by using a technique called ‘frequency hopping’ (FHSS) - skipping the transmission frequency around in a prearranged manner, causing the enemy to constantly retune (very rapidly) or ‘direct sequence’ (DSSS) where the digital message is added to a much higher bit-rate, pseudo random (PR) sequence. The code spreads the radio signal over a much wider bandwidth. In fact, so wide that the power may well be dispersed so that the total signal falls down into the background radio noise - and becomes invisible. Recovery is therefore a matter of i) knowing the original radio frequency ii) the pseudo random code and iii) and the PR code bit rate. Knowing these details means that synchronising receivers is not as difficult as may at first appear. The signal will just ‘pop up’ out of the noise when the correct values are achieved. (‘Processing Gain’)
The technique used in LoRa is ‘ CHIRP ’: Compressed High Intensity Radar Pulse. It is even more complex but simple with current technology. As the name may suggest, the background design requirement, it is not used to hide the radio signal but is employed because of other factors, not just processing gain but interference immunity, channel sharing and resistance to radio reflections (amongst others). It is therefore employed as security against operating conditions not for surveillance resistance. (Hedy Lamarr was a co-inventor and holds a patent for FHSS).
